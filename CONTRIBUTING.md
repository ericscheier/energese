# Contributing to energese

Thanks for considering a contribution. `energese` is part of
the open-source **emburden** ecosystem at
[emburden.org](https://emburden.org), stewarded for public release
by the **Emergi Foundation**
([github.com/emergi-foundation](https://github.com/emergi-foundation)).

**Canonical contribution policy** lives at the Foundation:
[emergi-foundation/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/emergi-foundation/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
This file carries only the `energese`-specific dev-setup and
style notes on top of that policy.

## Contact and license

- General correspondence: `info@emburden.org`.
- Foundation: `info@emrgi.org`.
- Security disclosures: `security@emrgi.org` (private).
- License: **AGPL-3.0-or-later** (see `LICENSE`). Contributions are
  accepted under the same license via the DCO sign-off convention
  (no CLA, no copyright assignment).

## How to contribute

Three tracks, in order of scope:

1. **Bug reports** at the issue tracker: describe the observed vs
   expected behavior, minimal reproducer, R session info
   (`sessionInfo()`), and the affected version. Search open + closed
   issues first.
2. **Feature suggestions** at the issue tracker with the `enhancement`
   label. Include the underlying research question the feature would
   answer, not just the API you'd like.
3. **Pull requests** for code, documentation, tests, or data-loader
   additions. Open an issue first for anything beyond a small fix so
   we can align on scope before you invest time.

## Development

Standard R package workflow: `devtools::load_all()`, `devtools::test()`,
`devtools::check()`. Some pipelines depend on cached external data
under `~/.cache/emburdendata/`; see individual `download_*()` docstrings
for provisioning. A working `emburden` ecosystem checkout (sibling
packages `emburdendata`, `emburdengeo`, `emburdenstats`,
`emburdenutil`, `emburdenweather`, `emburdenhealth`, `emburdenvis`,
etc.) is required for most integration paths.

## Style

- Follow the tidyverse style guide for R.
- Snake_case for functions, columns, variables.
- Comments in code only where the *why* is non-obvious. Well-named
  functions and clear code are preferred to running commentary.
- Public functions carry roxygen documentation with `@examples` and
  a `\dontrun{}` block for network- or cache-dependent examples.
- Tests live under `tests/testthat/` and follow the existing
  `test-<module>.R` naming.

## Attribution and naming policy

- **Commit-message attribution** for AI coding-assistant collaboration
  (Claude Code and similar) is **not** included on commits going
  forward, per project policy set on 2026-09-19. The overall
  AI-collaboration disclosure lives at `AUTHORS.md`; per-commit tags
  are considered redundant given that project-level disclosure.
- **Named individuals** (project maintainers, external collaborators)
  are **not** listed in code, documentation, commit messages, or
  rendered publications by default. Contributors who want personal
  attribution can request it at `info@emburden.org` and it will be
  added to `AUTHORS.md`; the default is role-based
  ("emburden project", "external reviewer", "external collaborator")
  which keeps the public surface impersonal and stable across staff
  changes.
- **Scholarly citations** (Odum, Deming and Stephan, Hruschka et al.,
  etc.) are exempt from the naming policy; citing published methods
  by author is the norm and required for academic legibility.
- **`git log`** contains the raw commit-author record and is
  authoritative for who contributed which lines. `AUTHORS.md` is the
  human-readable summary and may aggregate contributors under role
  labels.

## Contributor Certificate of Origin

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
convention: by opening a pull request you certify that you have the
right to submit the contribution under the project license. No
separate CLA. `git commit -s` (sign-off) is welcomed but not required.

## Ecosystem-wide policy

The ecosystem uses a three-tier hosting model:

- **Dev**: `ScheierVentures/*` (private) — working repos.
- **Mirror**: `ericscheier/*` (public) — where you're reading
  this. External collaborators track this tier.
- **Release**: `emergi-foundation/*` (public) — tagged versions,
  citable via DOI.

Cross-cutting policies (publication workflow, per-release quality
gate, gated-data handling, attribution + naming policy, release
cadence) live in
[emburden-site/docs/PRIVATE_TO_PUBLIC.md](https://github.com/ericscheier/emburden-site/blob/master/docs/PRIVATE_TO_PUBLIC.md).

Contributing to this repo (at Mirror tier) enters the ecosystem via
the standard PR flow. Contributions land on Mirror first, sync to
Dev privately, and reach Release on the next tagged version.
